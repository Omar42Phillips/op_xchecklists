# op_xchecklists

Checklist scripts built for select aircraft, designed for use with the [XChecklists plugin](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/20785-xchecklist-linwinmac3264/) in the [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com) flight simulator.

## Installation
1. Each folder in this repository is for a specific aircraft, found in your "Aircraft" folder of your X-Plane installation.
2. Copy the related "clist.txt" file from this repository to the related Aircraft folder.

## Usage
1. If you haven't already done so, download and install the [XChecklists plugin](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/20785-xchecklist-linwinmac3264/)
2. Restart X-Plane. You should see the "XChecklist" available in the plugin menu.
3. Although I've tried to remain as close to whatever official/avaialble checklists I could get my hands on, some of them are very inefficiently written or miss some critial step; so I have made some choices which fit my personal preferences or help reduce common errors I'm prone to making. At your discretion, consult your aircraft documentation for official checklist(s).

## Troubleshooting / Development
* I highly recommend that you install the [DataRefTool](https://github.com/leecbaker/datareftool) plugin to view the status of the relevant "datarefs".
* That said, most checklist items, even those that I've managed to automate, can be manually checked-off.
   * If you want to confirm gear as down when it's actually not, who am I to dictate otherwise ;)
